        <div class="column left"> This project was based on the two pandemics that are going on in our country right now, and creating art around the reflection of people’s mental health. In order to achieve this, our team brainstormed every week on what questions we would ask our user in order to get an answer that an API server could then produce an image back to them. We felt collectively that an “input/output” type model would serve us best, except instead of a set of inputs to choose from like a quiz, you had freedom to express your feelings in the language you wanted to. This is how we came up with the name--instead of typical input that code would produce an output for, like lab 11, the user would input their emotions.

The output of each element - images, title and font, and the review are controlled by a single button. When the “create” button is clicked, each element outputs and forms the user’s movie poster.</div>

        <div class="row">
        <div class="column left"> Throughout this entire quarter, with the complete implementation of remote learning, the six of us have all noticed the sizable amount of students who either live in or have relocated to a location in another timezone. Because the time difference makes it significantly harder to plan and formulate a schedule, we wanted to create a timezone converter to help them. After browsing numerous webpages, it became apparent that a big portion of them are not that as straightforward or user-friendly as anticipated. Given this, it is our aspiration to build a website that is especially sleek in design and uncomplicated in function in order to have what is hopefully a user-friendly timezone conversion tool. Our final website consists of an input-area where the user can manually type in their initial time, dropdown boxes for UTC offset selection, and a conversion button. Along with this, below the area where the converted time is printed, there are six additional dropdown boxes that correlate to each continent (excluding Antarctica). When expanded, they list the respective timezones within each geographical area and display what the converted time would be in every one of them as well. Another feature that we included were informational pages and images, which are accessible through the latter dropdown boxes and detail fun facts about each timezone.</div>

        <div class="column left"> Our project is a website that simulates the experience of going to the beach. In order to create this experience, we used pictures of beaches along with various beach sounds for the user to take in. We also incorporated a separate page that offers relaxing gifs of the ocean/beach. There is one other page that contains the ability to toggle between two pictures of the beach during the day and the beach during the night.  The purpose of this project is to make it feel like one is venturing to the beach but in your own home.  This is so people do not expose themselves to COVID19 or spread it to others. We made this in an attempt to help prevent the spread of disease while also allowing the user to safely enjoy a mental vacation indoors. With this website we wanted to bring the experience of the beach to the user, thus solving the problem of how to experience the outdoors.</div>

When you first click on the page, there is a curtain, that with a click, will open, which is similar to a movie theater. We will have a home page that will allow the user to search through all the years, for movies that have been nominated for Best Picture. Also on the home page, is links to other pages that have specific years. There is also a link on the home page, that links to a page about us and our favorite nominated movies.  Each of the year pages, have information on all the best picture nominated films from that year which includes: the title, genre, director, and if it won. The user will pick a topic from the drop down menu (All Movies, Directors, Title, Genre, Winner), and will be able to input whatever they want. If the search function finds a director/film/genre/ with what the user inputs, it will return the movie/s. On the year pages, there will also be a carousel of the movie pictures.</div>

        <div class="row">
        <div class="column left"> With the pandemic locking the majority of the country inside, many people are trying to find ways to pass the time. Our project aims to take something as simple as reading and create a goal that motivates our users to expand their creative and knowledgeable sides without losing that drive. Our site is useful to students who are forced to take classes on Zoom and read through textbooks and assigned journals, non-essential workers that have to set up a make shift workstudy as they bring their lists and files to the bedroom/kitchen, and even the lazy person who isjust bored and wants something to do on the weekend. Most of us have something that we need to get done before a certain date, and what better way to avoid last minute readings than a site that helps you set a comfortable pace? “The Procrastinator's Library” is a website that helps users set up reading goals for theircurrent and future projects. The user will be asked to input the title of what they are reading, the amount of pages the book has, and the amount of days they have to read the book. When they click the button “Add book!”, the site calculates how many pages they need to read per day and returns this number along with all the input information. All of this will be logged and saved within the site so that the user can look over their reading goals even when they exit the page and return later on.</div>

        <div class="row">
        <div class="column left"> The purpose of our website is to elegantly organize a space that records accurate information about the numerous scandals that Nestle, P&amp;G and Johnson and Johnson have all been accused of. Our site places particular focus on companies with a scandalous history and world wide reach that people might not be aware of. These companies own much of the food and day to day products that many people buy daily. And so, our goal is to try to inform the general public of the wrong doings these companies have done, and hope that they will from now on make informed decisions on whether or not they decide to continue to support that said company. We created a generator that takes your name as an input and will give you a short narrative about a worker or a victim of a big company that has a reputation for scandals and how it has affected them. We did this to create a more personal and emotional interaction. We try to be as informative as possible on the site, to open the user’s eyes to the companies that are untrustworthy. Based on which company you’re grouped into, it will link the user to a seperate html page that details other scandals related to the company they were grouped into. The page contains each corporate crime with a short description and clickable images that serve as links to separate articles that discuss the scandals in greater detail. At the bottom of the page there is a link to the final page, which has our final message, and a button that would allow the user to read through each companies’ wrongdoing at one click of the button.</div>

        <div class="row">
        <div class="column left"> In a lighthearted response to the grim situation in which we find ourselves during the pandemic, our group was inspired to create a dating simulator for our final project. One of the most prominent misfortunes of COVID-19 and the call to social distance has been the experience of loneliness, amplified in prolonged quarantine. Our project seeks to alleviate some of that loneliness by creating characters and scenarios for the user to explore. The characters, their professions, and personalities are all informed by the pandemic situation; as the user interacts with the different personalities through the dating app, they will notice the dialogue is heavily influenced by the stressors and topics of the time.Our project takes on a journey to “Choose Your Own Adventure,” wherein the user is given choices of texts to send to the “date-able” characters via the virtual app. Each selection in a given conversation leads them down a unique conversation path: while some pathways may end in perfect matchmaking, others show incompatibility between the character and the user. In these times of heightened pressures and anxiety in social interactions through digital media, we felt it important to navigate - for ourselves, but also for anyone using dating apps and the like - the conflicting intentions and hardships understood both individually and when looking for a romantic partner in an era of COVID-19.</div>

We were hoping to make an interactive webpage that is visually pleasing and calming to look at, as well as functioned as a proper to-do list. This, however, was not our original idea for our project. We had originally aimed to create a music directory but changed our idea earlier this week because we wanted something that could be applied to daily life. In quarantine, it can be hard to keep track of what you need to do and by when, especially since recently a lot of days seem to blend together. We wanted something that was fun to use but also made you feel good about the little things, which is why we chose to add audio features. For us, it feels like the computer is almost encouraging you as you add things to the list.</div>

Oneof the biggest problems besides social distancing (that is currently in place) is the use of masks. Using our knowledge of how to create a basic HTML webpage and the different uses of JavaScript and CSS, we are going to target the people who question what mask would be best to use, given their circumstances. This site will allow you to identify the different masks that are available to us during this crisis, and offers alternative options to non-essential personnel. We divided the different types of masks to each team member and created an HTML webpage based on the mask we were assigned.For our home page, we have a basic heading with different characters wearing the different types of masks, you can click these characters and explore the content of the type of mask. In our individual sites, we have explored the N95 mask, clothmasks, surgical masks, and homemade/bandana masks. Each html explores what the different contents that involve the mask that you choose. With “Scroll to Reveal” functions, interactive sites, interactive graphs, back buttons, you can see which mask is available to you.</div>
