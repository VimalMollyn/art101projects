        <h1>ART 101 Final Projects, Spring 2020</h1>

        <p> Deep Painterly Harmonization is an extension of style transfer, and includes a content object which is placed on the style image. The network then harmonizes the style and the content.
        My group reimplemented the Deep Painterly Harmonization algorithm in Tensorflow, and extend the uses of the algorithm to explore different categories of visual media modification. We wrote a paper in which we discussed the ramifications of style harmonization and style transfer on societal concepts of art, and compared the results of the Tensorflow and Torch algorithms.

        The project is called ManuMorph because I was delighted with the idea that we would incorporate one of the group members, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/manumathewthomas/" target="_blank">Manu Mathew Thomas</a>, into famous works of art - ex: the “Manu Lisa” or the “Venus de Manu”.</p>
