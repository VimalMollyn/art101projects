        <div class="column left"> This project was based on the two pandemics that are going on in our country right now, and creating art around the reflection of people’s mental health. In order to achieve this, our team brainstormed every week on what questions we would ask our user in order to get an answer that an API server could then produce an image back to them. We felt collectively that an “input/output” type model would serve us best, except instead of a set of inputs to choose from like a quiz, you had freedom to express your feelings in the language you wanted to. This is how we came up with the name--instead of typical input that code would produce an output for, like lab 11, the user would input their emotions.

        <div class="column left"> We are building an internet utility where users can create movie posters that satirize the cliches of Hollywood genres. Users can input their own creative title, choose a genre for the title, and then choose what poster image they want to display it on. The output of each element - images, title and font, and the review are controlled by a single button. When the “create” button is clicked, each element outputs and forms the user’s movie poster.</div>

        <div class="column left"> Today, COVID-19 has induced a lot of stress and anxiety, so we wanted to utilize this website to serve as a solace and a mode of entertainment for the community. Our project acts as an electronic music set that functions as a form of music therapy – keyboard letters Q through I behaves as a piano,letters A through L elicit drum sounds when pressed, and letters Z through N plays the strings of an electric guitar. Our website uses a JavaScript framework known as Reveal.js that allows us to create and customize our content into a powerpoint presentation format.</div>

        <div class="row">
        <div class="column left"> Throughout this entire quarter, with the complete implementation of remote learning, the six of us have all noticed the sizable amount of students who either live in or have relocated to a location in another timezone. Because the time difference makes it significantly harder to plan and formulate a schedule, we wanted to create a timezone converter to help them. After browsing numerous webpages, it became apparent that a big portion of them are not that as straightforward or user-friendly as anticipated. Given this, it is our aspiration to build a website that is especially sleek in design and uncomplicated in function in order to have what is hopefully a user-friendly timezone conversion tool. Our final website consists of an input-area where the user can manually type in their initial time, dropdown boxes for UTC offset selection, and a conversion button. Along with this, below the area where the converted time is printed, there are six additional dropdown boxes that correlate to each continent (excluding Antarctica). When expanded, they list the respective timezones within each geographical area and display what the converted time would be in every one of them as well. Another feature that we included were informational pages and images, which are accessible through the latter dropdown boxes and detail fun facts about each timezone.</div>

        <div class="row">
        <div class="column left"> Our project is a website that simulates the experience of going to the beach. In order to create this experience, we used pictures of beaches along with various beach sounds for the user to take in. We also incorporated a separate page that offers relaxing gifs of the ocean/beach. There is one other page that contains the ability to toggle between two pictures of the beach during the day and the beach during the night.  The purpose of this project is to make it feel like one is venturing to the beach but in your own home.  This is so people do not expose themselves to COVID19 or spread it to others. We made this in an attempt to help prevent the spread of disease while also allowing the user to safely enjoy a mental vacation indoors. With this website we wanted to bring the experience of the beach to the user, thus solving the problem of how to experience the outdoors.</div>

        <div class="row">
        <div class="column left"> Our project is going to be an online utility that serves a search function of the Best Picture nominated Oscars. When you first click on the page, there is a curtain, that with a click, will open, which is similar to a movie theater. We will have a home page that will allow the user to search through all the years, for movies that have been nominated for Best Picture. Also on the home page, is links to other pages that have specific years. There is also a link on the home page, that links to a page about us and our favorite nominated movies.  Each of the year pages, have information on all the best picture nominated films from that year which includes: the title, genre, director, and if it won. The user will pick a topic from the drop down menu (All Movies, Directors, Title, Genre, Winner), and will be able to input whatever they want. If the search function finds a director/film/genre/ with what the user inputs, it will return the movie/s. On the year pages, there will also be a carousel of the movie pictures.</div>
