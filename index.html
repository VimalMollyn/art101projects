        <div class="column left"> This project was based on the two pandemics that are going on in our country right now, and creating art around the reflection of people’s mental health. In order to achieve this, our team brainstormed every week on what questions we would ask our user in order to get an answer that an API server could then produce an image back to them. We felt collectively that an “input/output” type model would serve us best, except instead of a set of inputs to choose from like a quiz, you had freedom to express your feelings in the language you wanted to. This is how we came up with the name--instead of typical input that code would produce an output for, like lab 11, the user would input their emotions.

        <div class="column left"> We are building an internet utility where users can create movie posters that satirize the cliches of Hollywood genres. Users can input their own creative title, choose a genre for the title, and then choose what poster image they want to display it on. The output of each element - images, title and font, and the review are controlled by a single button. When the “create” button is clicked, each element outputs and forms the user’s movie poster.</div>

        <div class="column left"> Today, COVID-19 has induced a lot of stress and anxiety, so we wanted to utilize this website to serve as a solace and a mode of entertainment for the community. Our project acts as an electronic music set that functions as a form of music therapy – keyboard letters Q through I behaves as a piano,letters A through L elicit drum sounds when pressed, and letters Z through N plays the strings of an electric guitar. Our website uses a JavaScript framework known as Reveal.js that allows us to create and customize our content into a powerpoint presentation format.</div>

        <div class="column left"> Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance.
